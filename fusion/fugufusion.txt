## Fugu Tempura Tacos
The thing about tempura batter is it should be mixed with equal parts ice cold soda water and egg yolks 
(2 is good), stirred rapidly with chopsticks for only a short time 
in order to preserve the lumpy quality characteristic to tempura. 
 
So, after heating your wok full of an oil with a high smoking point- sesame, 
peanut or vegetable (or even a mixture thereof)- oil to 190°F, cutting the fugu
into chunks, prepare your batter mixture. When the batter floats the oil is ready to go, 
though you don’t want to fry too much as once as the oil temperature will drop too low, 
screwing the Kitchen Adonis image your drooling audience has of you all to hell.

Take out of oil after 2-3 minutes and nicely golden, resting on a paper towel for a bit to soak up excess oil. 
Salt it! Of course you’ve already made your red onion, tomato, pepper based pico de gallo, 
cut the avocado into long green quarter moons, and been heating your corn tortillas all the while, right? 

So, once your tempura's done and dried a bit, throw it on that tortilla, 
adding the previously mentioned accoutrements and get to eating while it’s still hot.
